# ------- Additional colors ----------------

# Use alarm colors only when you mean to indicate an alarm.
# Avoid using 'Red' which might suggest an alarm
# just because you like the look of red.
# STOP looks similar to red=MAJOR alarm, and is allowed
# for 'STOP' type of buttons

# Attention looks similar to a MINOR alarm.
# It is meant to draw attention
ATTENTION = YELLOW
Attention = YELLOW

# The colors for On/Off, Open/Close etc,.
# "ON" does not necessarily mean 'device is turned on', but
# stands for 'indicator is on, active, illuminated'.
# For a 'motor is at target' type indicator, the motor would
# actually be 'off' while the indicator uses the 'ON' color.
#
# If one of the states represents an alarm, the corresponding alarm color may be used.
# For example, a limit switch indicator could use colors "OFF" and "MAJOR":
# OFF when idle, MAJOR when the limit switch was hit and this is an abnormal situation
# that requires attention.
ON = LED-GREEN-ON
On = LED-GREEN-ON
OFF = LED-GREEN-OFF
