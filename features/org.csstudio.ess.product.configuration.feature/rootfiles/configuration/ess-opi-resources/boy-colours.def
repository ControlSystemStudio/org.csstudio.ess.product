# ------- Additional colors ----------------

# "ON" does not necessarily mean 'device is turned on', but
# stands for 'indicator is on, active, illuminated'.
# For a 'motor is at target' type indicator, the motor would
# actually be 'off' while the indicator uses the 'ON' color.
#
# If one of the states represents an alarm, the corresponding alarm color may be used.
# For example, a limit switch indicator could use colors "OFF" and "MAJOR":
# OFF when idle, MAJOR when the limit switch was hit and this is an abnormal situation
# that requires attention.
